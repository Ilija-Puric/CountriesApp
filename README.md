# Country Filter Application

Project made for the faculty course "Web programming".

During the time invested in making this the best project i could. I learned a lot about ASYNC/AWAIT, the FETCH API, using PROMISES, and a whole lot of about development for the web overall. 

For basic styling i used SASS, and @keyframes for animations. No external CSS libraries were used in the making of this project.
